            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to HappyTails, where every paw has a story and every story deserves a happy ending. At Paws, we're on a mission to provide a second chance for animals who have faced abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Our hearts beat for those furry friends who need a loving home the most.</p>
            <p>Founded on the principle of compassion, HappyTails is more than just a pet adoption website—it's a sanctuary of hope, where tails wag with joy and hearts are filled with love. We believe in the transformative power of adoption, not just for the animals, but for the families whose lives they enrich.</p>
            <p>Our dedicated team works tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals in need. Each furry friend that enters our care receives medical attention, love, and support to heal both physically and emotionally. We strive to match each pet with the perfect forever home, ensuring a lifelong bond of love and companionship.</p>
            <p>Join us in making a difference, one paw at a time. Whether you're looking to adopt, foster, volunteer, or donate, together, we can rewrite the stories of those who deserve a happily ever after. Welcome to HappyTails—where every adoption is a celebration of love and resilience.</p>
